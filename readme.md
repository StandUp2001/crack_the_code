# Crack the code

This is an simple program that I to solve the game about cracking the code.

## How to run the program

It is created in Rust. You can run the program by using the following commands (see below).
It will ask you to input the codes and how many of that is correct and how many of that is in the wrong position.
This will be need to put in the `info.json` file. (So don't worry if it fails the first time. That just means that the file was not created yet.)

### With the source code

After you have cloned the repository, you can run the program by using the following command: (make sure you have installed Rust)

```bash
cargo run
```

```bash
cargo run --release
```

### With the binary

After you have cloned the repository, you can use this executable file to run the program. You can run the program by using the following command:
(You need to have the permission to execute the file. If you don't have the permission, you can use the command `chmod +x crack_the_code` to give the permission to execute the file.)

```bash
./crack_the_code
```
